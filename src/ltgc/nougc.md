# UGC Availability
To prevent Lightingale Community from getting blocked as a whole in certain countries, we've been forced to restrict or deny direct access from those countries. A restricted service coverage would've been marginally better than nothing at all.

We offer two levels of UGC services: high-liberty and restricted. Levels are separated by the measures avalable to the users, and users' ability to freely express whatever they desire. Some countries may have been denied direct access from high-liberty UGC services, but not restricted ones.

If you've been redirected to this page, it's likely that you have been denied direct access to our UGC service, and we have no other choice but to offer our deepest apology.
