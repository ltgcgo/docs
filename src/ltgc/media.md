# Media requirements
*These requirements are heavily influenced by [our own content encoding guidelines](./encode.md) and [Technical Delivery Standards of BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/delivery/technical-requirements).*

> **Warning**
> 
> As the purpose of these guidelines are to ensure a mininum viable set of quality standards that does not interfere the enjoyment of the audience, as such they are intentionally made to be more lenient than what BBC requires. If you intend to publish media tuned to broadcasters' requirements, please refer to their related specifications.
