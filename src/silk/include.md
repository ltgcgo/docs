## Requesting instance inclusion
We're open to include more instances to the list, as long as they satisfy the following criteria. If you host an instance that's MLP-oriented, please [contact us](https://ltgc.cc/about.htm) to have your instance included.

## Manual account inclusion
If your account isn't on any of the instances listed above, and said instance isn't mainly for the MLP community, you can follow the [hook account](https://equestria.social/@silk) to get yourself included manually. The hook account may also follow some accounts to have the same effect.
