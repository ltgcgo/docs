# Inclusion
## Instances
Silk will attempt to merge public timelines on all servers listed below.

### Non-CW
The following instances have posts' content warning set as-is.

* [Equestria Social](https://equestria.social)
* [is-a.horse](https://mastodon.is-a.horse)
* [Our Town](https://our-town.social)
* [Mastopon](https://pon.ee)
* [Ponies on Mastodon](https://pony.social)
* [social.inex.rocks](https://social.inex.rocks)
* [BronyFurry Mastodon](https://mstdn.bronyfurry.com)

### CW by default
Due to differences of the server rules, all of the following instances have posts' content warning enabled by default to comply the [moderation rules](mod.md).
* ~~[Pone.Social](https://pone.social)~~ (removed due to technical difficulties on their side)

## Requesting instance inclusion
We're open to include more instances to the list. If you host an instance which satisfies the following criteria, please [contact us](https://ltgc.cc/about.htm) to have your instance included.

* MLP-themed
* Not a roleplay instance

## Manual account inclusion
If your account isn't on any of the instances listed above, and said instance isn't mainly for the MLP community, you can follow the [hook account](https://equestria.social/@silk) to get yourself included manually. The hook account may also follow some accounts to have the same effect, mainly when said accounts do not have the ability to follow anyone (e.g. [Equestria Daily](https://pony.social/@equestriadaily@bird.im-in.space)).
