# Service Usage
For ease of use, Silk provides an API and a web frontend.

## API
Please refer to [API](api.md).

## Web frontend
The web frontend is expected to become publicly available at [mlp.ltgc.cc](https://mlp.ltgc.cc/silk/).

If you have internal access, you might also be able to try it out at [staging.ltgc.cc](https://staging.ltgc.cc/silk/) (`NXDOMAIN` expected).
