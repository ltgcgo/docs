# Moderation
To grant as many members in the MLP community a pleasant experience as possible, we are enforcing a series of moderation rules on the merged timeline. The rules may change without prior notice, but we try our best to keep everyone notified.

## Account auto-CW exemption
If you are on a server with content warning automatically enabled in the timeline, you can exempt yourself from the auto-CW status by following the hook account, as long as you follow the following rules. Violation of any rule below will get your auto-CW exemption status revoked.

## Account exclusion
Violation of any rule below will get your account excluded from the merged timeline altogether.
