# Silk
Silk is an attempt to unify timelines of the MLP fandom. It is achieved by merging all public timelines of instances with Mastodon-compatible APIs, and accounts that followed this account if on other instances. To avoid stressing tracked servers and accounts, WebSocket and SSE connections are utilized whenever possible, with caches enforced.
