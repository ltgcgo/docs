# Recommended implementation practices
## Ideas
Meek as a general terms, covers techniques reconstructing states of duplex sockets over underlying measures of communication. It doesn't have to be constrained to a single set of views. Under ideal circumstances, Meek can achieve full socket state decoupling with arbitrary socket delivery, however reaching those
